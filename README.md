This is a rather basic mapping tool that we made to help in the 2018 FRC challenge.
In order to use it, go into the file mapping and add the co-ordinates into POINT_LIST. You will most likely have to change the limits of the axis (extent) in order to use it.
Make sure that your background image is in the same directory and is called 'map.jpg'
